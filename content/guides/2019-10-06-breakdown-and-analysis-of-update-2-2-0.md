## Introduction:

New Update! It's what we've all been waiting for, everyone! There's our Tier 8! New crafts to master and even more expensive stuff to sell! I can already smell the gold brewing extensively from here!

But, what else does this update have in store for us? Hmm? Let's see!

### Pumpkins!

Along with this update, we got Halloween decors for Spooktober! No kidding, I've been a fan of decorating since day one. While people are saving up for their upgrades and expansions, I was out buying plants, stained glass walls, torches, fireplaces and a fabulous couch!

For this update, we got **PUMPKIN HEADS** and with my kitty cat head, I can now meow with all my heart! Did I already say we got **CAT** walls and floors!? GET DECORATING!!! **NOW.**

### What else is up?!

We have a new Dungeon called **Chronos Ruins.** It costs **15,000,000 gold or 2,000 gems** to unlock, and will of course, like the previous dungeons, help us with crafting Tier 8 items!

We also got 2 new NPCS that produce resources. Meet Serene and Maylee! Serene produces **Ether** and Maylee will give us **Jewels** ! More helpers, more fun! *(and more buildings to invest in...)*

Also, they increased our bins' max capacities, so it won't hurt much losing some of them to make way for Jewel and Ether bins.

We also got Elemental blueprints! (More items to find and master for our collectors!) The only way to get them is if you get lucky in a chest. But remember, just because you can't change who or what they are, doesn't mean you can't collect them!

## New and Improved way of Investing!

If you're a new player being held captive in a large guild, at least once in your game life you may have experienced not being able to get investment perks like additional resources and crafting boosts because a tap on a building will cost you your hard-earned hundreds of thousands to millions.

Well, not anymore!!! Unlike before, the amount you can invest is now based on how much you previously invested on a building. The less you have invested, the less expensive it will cost you per tap. Similarly, as your investment increases, the more expensive it will be. Below are the investment costs for someone with 30G when compared someone with 30M.

Our investments, even when widely spread out among buildings don't count as much anymore compared to the people who are low-invested in the said building. As you can see, no matter how expensive these amounts get, it will be counted as **One** **Tick.** For me, this will bring a more balanced flow of investments in a city. We can't have one-man cities anymore, if you know what I mean. Everyone is now obliged to step up and help their city when needed.

Gold was generally converted into ticks, it is not based on how many times we invested or tapped into a building. So, you might want to halt on investing and/or buying more ticks while the rest of your city are still not on the update. This should save you more gold as their investments are still not counted. You need to see first where your ticks can be more utilized.

There are people both in world chat and in discord who are still confused about the new investment system. Some are even unhappy about this change. Replacing how buildings are upgraded is a REAL game changer. For now, we still can't see how much this affects our cities with the grace period we're given to buy out the buildings' debts. Luckily though, it will be easier to keep pumping gold into buildings as they will only take a minute to upgrade! _(**Longest 60 seconds of my life.)**_

## The Academy's Scholar: Evelyn!

The 5% multicraft chance on enchantments brought by Evelyn is now changed into +25% Merchant XP bonus. Those who previously unlocked her received 50 Ascension Shards as compensation for this change.

So far, all I've seen from the community are protests about this change. According to some, they bought it for that 5% multi-craft chance more than the wands themselves and crafting their own runestones. They most certainly did not expect 25% Merchant XP.

At higher levels, 50+ specifically, there's not much we can unlock anymore and if there were, they're very expensive gold-wise. People choose to just use gems instead. These gold amounts are doable, yes, but there is so much more we can do with anything above 100M like investing it on a building, for example.

I don't have The Academy unlocked, but I agree with the others that Merchant XP becomes useless at some point. Our levels ain't gonna upgrade them buildings, extra enchantments from time to time will. So i'm throwing in a **#JusticeForEvelyn!**

On a side note, have you checked out your Ascension Tracks?! If you ascend enough items and reach an ascension milestone, there's a number of things you can claim such as gold and gems! You can also get **+25% Worker XP bonuses, -10% surcharge energy costs, x1.5 Quality Chance AND 5% multicraft chance!!!**

## More!

It's what we've all been asking for! A faster way to invest! Just hold down on the **+** button and you won't have to sprain your finger tapping!

You can also invest on The Laboratory and The Academy now, even if you don't have them unlocked for yourself. It's gonna be really helpful as there are cities with very few members who has them and buildings do get expensive as they grow. More investors mean easier to upgrade buildings!

Do you need superior items for your crafts but don't want to tap for like, 50x to buy them? Well, requesting Items with quality is now doable! BUT!--- Do you know what I'm most excited about? The **MEOW** sound! They made enchanting MORE fun! Try enchanting an item with the Cat Spirit and embrace your inner cat!

As one of the ancient players, probably the best **TIP** I can give you is adapt to these changes, learn to navigate around it AND with it. Changing a few things on your play style won't hurt that much.

Don't worry! They always take our feedbacks into consideration and we've seen that happen countless times. However, things don't always change the way we want it to or as fast as we expect them to change. Let's trust the Game Gods for now and just do what we do best: **Craft and Sell!**
