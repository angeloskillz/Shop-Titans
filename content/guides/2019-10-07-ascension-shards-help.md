  Everything you need to know about your precious ascension shards (and where to
  use them!)

### Introduction:
As you all know, I'm  One of the most frequently asked questions I've seen both in discord and on wc that the Game's built-in FAQs don't answer is about what we can do with our limited shards.


Along the way, I'll also tell you my secret to endless crafting. Most people way up in the leaderboards are already doing this, but for those of you who are still not in on the secret, this is your time to shine!

### What are Ascension Shards!?

Let's start with getting them. 
The purpose of them is**

### So, what to Ascend?!

The answer is simple: Whatever you wanna craft forever (and ever) or... till a new blueprint tier comes out.

But, therein still lies the question, **What will I craft forever?!**

Well, 2 things:
1. Items with the highest GPS and/or GPE.

>> *GPS = Gold per second (Most profitable)*

>> *GPE = Gold per energy (Easier to sell/surcharge AND profitable)*

You probably think people are just selling whatever sells for more and that is true. However, you also need to consider the resource materials an item takes to craft.

Rss that usually go together are:
> Wood + Ironwood

> Iron + Steel

> Leather + Fabric

> Herb + Oil

I strongly advice against using/crafting items that uses any of the following combinations unless of course, for mastery's sake:
> Wood + Ironwood + Steel

> Iron + Leather + Steel

> Leather + Herb + Oil

If you're fairly active and want to continuously craft your money-makers, it's fair to stay away from these items because eventually, you'll run out of them.

>> **Tip!** Whatever you can surcharge, ALWAYS sell on your shop. Unless they're going for more than 2x the base price in the market! After months of playing and hours of watching the market, the ones you can usually sell for gold with ridiculously good prices are mostly flawless, epics, and legendaries! *(But did I already mention Champion Requests? Shh!)*

2. Tier 1-4s!

Never **ever** underestimate the power of low tiers and crafting them yourself!
