## Introduction

Meow y'all.

## Where it's NOT wise to spend your gems?

Also take into consideration, there are stuff you can easily buy/unlock with coins if you're patient enough to wait till you get to a certain level, esp if it's less than level 50. At an early stage, you'll prolly think 2M for crafting slot 6 is too much, but at level 40 you're probably already making T6s. Wait it up.
